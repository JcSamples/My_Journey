## Section 1: Identifying the Type of Attack

**Potential Cause:**  
The connection timeout error on the website may have been caused by a brute force attack. The logs indicate the following events:

- **Start:** `14:18:32.192571` from IP `your.machine.52444`
- **End:** `14:25:29.576597` IP `greatrecipesforme.com.http > your.machine.56378`

**Possible Attack:**  
The pattern observed in the logs suggests a brute force attack attempting to disrupt the service by overwhelming it with connection requests.

## Section 2: Explaining the Impact of the Attack

**Three-Way Handshake Process:**

1. **SYN** - The client sends a SYN message to initiate a connection.
2. **SYN-ACK** - The server responds with a SYN-ACK message to acknowledge the request.
3. **ACK** - The client sends an ACK message to establish the connection.

**Attack Description:**  
A malicious actor might be sending a large number of SYN packets simultaneously, causing a network flood. This overloads the server, leading to connection timeouts for legitimate users.

**Log Analysis:**

- **Initial Connection:**  
  IP `your.machine.52444` made a connection request to `yummyrecipesforme.com` through port 52444 and received a response.

- **Subsequent Connections:**  
  Later, a new connection was initiated from port 36086 to `yummyrecipesforme.com.http`. The HTTP protocol was used for all connections, specifically port 80, which indicates the absence of encryption.

- **Download Activity:**  
  At `14:18:36.786589`, IP `your.machine.36086` made a GET request to `yummyrecipesforme.com.http`, successfully downloading data. Further connections were made to `greatrecipesforme.com.http`, where a third connection from port 56378 led to another download. The unencrypted HTTP protocol was again utilized on port 80.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- **Enforce Strong Passwords:**  
  Require complex passwords to reduce the risk of brute force attacks.

- **Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  
  Add an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of authentication.

- **Monitor Login Attempts:**  
  Track and alert on suspicious login activities to identify and mitigate attacks early.

- **Enforce Frequent Password Changes:**  
  Require users to update their passwords regularly to reduce the impact of compromised credentials.

- **Prevent Reuse of Old Passwords:**  
  Ensure that users cannot reuse previously used passwords to enhance security.

- **Limit Login Attempts:**  
  Implement a limit on the number of failed login attempts to prevent automated brute force attacks.
