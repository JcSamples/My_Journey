### Threat Intelligence 


Threat Intelligence (Predictive): The primary aim here is to anticipate the adversary's moves, ascertain their targets, and discern their methods of information acquisition. The adversary has a specific objective, and as a team involved in Threat Intelligence, our mission is to predict:

- The location of the intended attack
- The timing of the attack
- The operational strategies the adversary will employ
- The ultimate objectives of the adversary


Threat Hunting (Reactive and Proactive): Yes, the two terms are opposites, but they encapsulate the essence of Threat Hunting. An initiating event or incident, whether it occurs within our network or in a network of a similar industry, prompts our team to launch an operation to ascertain whether an adversary is present in the network, or if one was present and evaded detection.

### What is access control?

Access control is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources. In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management:

    Authentication confirms that the user is who they say they are.
    Session management identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user.
    Access control determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action that they are attempting to perform.

Broken access controls are common and often present a critical security vulnerability. Design and management of access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that applies business, organizational, and legal constraints to a technical implementation. Access control design decisions have to be made by humans so the potential for errors is high.
