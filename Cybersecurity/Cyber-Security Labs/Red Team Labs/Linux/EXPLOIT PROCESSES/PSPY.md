pspy is a command line tool designed to snoop on processes without need for root permissions. It allows you to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. as they execute. Great for enumeration of Linux systems in CTFs. Also great to demonstrate your colleagues why passing secrets as arguments on the command line is a bad idea.

Let's run `pspy` and have a look. The `-pf` flag tells the tool to print commands and file system events and `-i 1000` tells it to scan [procfs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/procfs.5.html) every 1000ms (or every second).

```shell-session
./pspy64 -pf -i 1000
```

````
# print both commands and file system events and scan procfs every 1000 ms (=1sec)
./pspy64 -pf -i 1000 

# place watchers recursively in two directories and non-recursively into a third
./pspy64 -r /path/to/first/recursive/dir -r /path/to/second/recursive/dir -d /path/to/the/non-recursive/dir

# disable printing discovered commands but enable file system events
./pspy64 -p=false -f
`````
