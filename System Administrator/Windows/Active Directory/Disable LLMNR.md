Mitre ATT&CK lists this technique as [ID: T1557.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), `Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay`.
We can disable LLMNR in Group Policy by going to Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Network --> DNS Client and enabling "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution."

It is not always possible to disable LLMNR and NetBIOS, and therefore we need ways to detect this type of attack behavior. One way is to use the attack against the attackers by injecting LLMNR and NBT-NS requests for non-existent hosts across different subnets and alerting if any of the responses receive answers which would be indicative of an attacker spoofing name resolution responses. This [blog post](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/) explains this method more in-depth.

Furthermore, hosts can be monitored for traffic on ports UDP 5355 and 137, and event IDs [4697](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4697) and [7045](https://www.manageengine.com/products/active-directory-audit/kb/system-events/event-id-7045.html) can be monitored for. Finally, we can monitor the registry key `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient` for changes to the `EnableMulticast` DWORD value. A value of `0` would mean that LLMNR is disabled.
