#### Order of Precedence

|**Level**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Local Group Policy`|The policies are defined directly to the host locally outside the domain. Any setting here will be overwritten if a similar setting is defined at a higher level.|
|`Site Policy`|Any policies specific to the Enterprise Site that the host resides in. Remember that enterprise environments can span large campuses and even across countries. So it stands to reason that a site might have its own policies to follow that could differentiate it from the rest of the organization. Access Control policies are a great example of this. Say a specific building or `site` performs secret or restricted research and requires a higher level of authentication for access to resources. You could specify those settings at the site level and ensure they are linked so as not to be overwritten by domain policy. This is also a great way to perform actions like printer and share mapping for users in specific sites.|
|`Domain-wide Policy`|Any settings you wish to have applied across the domain as a whole. For example, setting the password policy complexity level, configuring a Desktop background for all users, and setting a Notice of Use and Consent to Monitor banner at the login screen.|
|`Organizational Unit` (OU)|These settings would affect users and computers who belong to specific OUs. You would want to place any unique settings here that are role-specific. For example, the mapping of a particular share drive that can only be accessed by HR, access to specific resources like printers, or the ability for IT admins to utilize PowerShell and command-prompt.|
|`Any OU Policies nested within other OU's`|Settings at this level would reflect special permissions for objects within nested OUs. For example, providing Security Analysts a specific set of Applocker policy settings that differ from the standard IT Applocker settings.|

We can manage Group Policy from the Group Policy Management Console (found under Administrative Tools in the Start Menu on a domain controller), custom applications, or using the PowerShell [GroupPolicy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) module via command line. The Default Domain Policy is the default GPO that is automatically created and linked to the domain. It has the highest precedence of all GPOs and is applied by default to all users and computers. Generally, it is best practice to use this default GPO to manage default settings that will apply domain-wide. The Default Domain Controllers policy is also created automatically with a domain and sets baseline security and auditing settings for all domain controllers in a given domain. It can be customized as needed, like any GPO.
