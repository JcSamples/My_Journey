| **Privilege**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight` | This privilege could give our target user the right to log onto a host via Remote Desktop (RDP), which could potentially be used to obtain sensitive data or escalate privileges.                                                                                                                 |
| `SeBackupPrivilege`             | This grants a user the ability to create system backups and could be used to obtain copies of sensitive system files that can be used to retrieve passwords such as the SAM and SYSTEM Registry hives and the NTDS.dit Active Directory database file.                                            |
| `SeDebugPrivilege`              | This allows a user to debug and adjust the memory of a process. With this privilege, attackers could utilize a tool such as [Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz) to read the memory space of the Local System Authority (LSASS) process and obtain any credentials stored in memory. |
| `SeImpersonatePrivilege`        | This privilege allows us to impersonate a token of a privileged account such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be leveraged with a tool such as JuicyPotato, RogueWinRM, PrintSpoofer, etc., to escalate privileges on a target system.                                                        |
| `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`         | A user with this privilege can load and unload device drivers that could potentially be used to escalate privileges or compromise a system.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`      | This allows a process to take ownership of an object. At its most basic level, we could use this privilege to gain access to a file share or a file on a share that was otherwise not accessible to us.                                                                                           |
