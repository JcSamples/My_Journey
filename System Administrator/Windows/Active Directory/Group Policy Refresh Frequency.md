When a new GPO is created and linked, it could take up to 2 hours (120 minutes) until the settings take effect. This random offset of +/- 30 minutes is set to avoid overwhelming domain controllers by having all clients request Group Policy from the domain controller simultaneously.

It is possible to change the default refresh interval within Group Policy itself. Furthermore, we can issue the command `gpupdate /force` to kick off the update process. This command will compare the GPOs currently applied on the machine against the domain controller and either modify or skip them depending on if they have changed since the last automatic update.

We can modify the refresh interval via Group Policy by clicking on `Computer Configuration --> Policies --> Administrative Templates --> System --> Group Policy` and selecting `Set Group Policy refresh interval for computers`. While it can be changed, it should not be set to occur too often, or it could cause network congestion leading to replication issues.
