A restricted shell is a type of shell that limits the user's ability to execute commands. In a restricted shell, the user is only allowed to execute a specific set of commands or only allowed to execute commands in specific directories. Restricted shells are often used to provide a safe environment for users who may accidentally or intentionally damage the system or provide a way for users to access only certain system features
Some common examples of restricted shells include the `rbash` shell in Linux and the "Restricted-access Shell" in Windows.

To do this, the IT team sets up several `rbash`, `rksh`, and `rzsh` shells on the network and assigns each user to a specific shell. For example, external partners who need to access only certain network features, such as email and file sharing, are assigned to `rbash` shells, which limits their ability to execute specific commands and access certain directories. Contractors who need to access more advanced network features, such as database servers and web servers, are assigned to `rksh` shells, which provide them with more flexibility but still limit their abilities. Finally, employees who need to access the network for specific purposes, such as to run specific applications or scripts, are assigned to `rzsh` shells, which provide them with the most flexibility but still limit their ability to execute specific commands and access certain directories.
