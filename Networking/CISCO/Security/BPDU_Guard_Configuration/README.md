BPDU Guard (Bridge Protocol Data Unit Guard) is a network security feature used in Layer 2 networks, particularly in networks running the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). BPDU Guard is designed to protect the stability and security of the network by preventing potentially harmful or unauthorized devices from participating in STP.
