### AAA Server

An AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) server is a critical component in network security, particularly in environments where secure access control is essential. This server performs three main functions:

1. **Authentication**: The AAA server is responsible for verifying the identity of users or devices attempting to access the network. It ensures that only authorized personnel or devices can gain entry by validating credentials such as usernames, passwords, tokens, or certificates. Common protocols used for authentication include RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) and TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus).
    
2. **Authorization**: Once a user or device is authenticated, the AAA server determines what resources and services they are permitted to access. This step is crucial for enforcing security policies and ensuring that users only have access to the information and tools necessary for their roles.
    
3. **Accounting**: The server also tracks and logs user activities within the network. This can include login and logout times, accessed resources, and the duration of sessions. Accounting data is invaluable for auditing, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.
