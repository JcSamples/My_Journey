DHCP Snooping is a critical security feature in network management that helps protect against rogue DHCP servers and various types of network attacks, such as DHCP starvation or IP address spoofing. It works by monitoring and controlling the flow of DHCP messages within a network.

When DHCP Snooping is enabled, the switch designates certain ports as trusted (typically those connecting to legitimate DHCP servers) and others as untrusted (those connecting to end devices or potential rogue servers). The switch then inspects incoming DHCP messages and only allows DHCP offers from trusted ports. Additionally, DHCP Snooping builds a DHCP binding table, which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, ports, and VLANs. This table is used to validate DHCP responses and can also be leveraged by other security features like Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) and IP Source Guard.
