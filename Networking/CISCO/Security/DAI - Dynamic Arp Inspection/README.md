DAI protects the network by intercepting all ARP requests and replies and validating them against a trusted database, such as the DHCP snooping binding table, which stores valid IP-to-MAC address mappings. If an ARP packet does not match the trusted entries, DAI discards the packet, preventing the spoofing attempt. By ensuring that only legitimate ARP communications are allowed, DAI enhances network security and protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and other forms of network disruption.
